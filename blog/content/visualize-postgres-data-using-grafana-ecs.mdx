## Introduction

Observability is a crucial factor in the success of any business.
To achieve observability, we can leverage the power of Grafana,
an open-source platform that enables us to query, visualize, alert
, and understand our metrics.

In this blog we demonstrate how can use Grafana to visualize data 
in our Postgres database. Furthormore, we deploy Grafana on 
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), a fully managed container 
orchestration service. By the end of this blog,
you will have a good understanding of Grafana, and ECS.
