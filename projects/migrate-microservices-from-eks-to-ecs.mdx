Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. It is a 
great service for running containerized applications, but it comes with a cost. The initial
setup costs around 60 bucks per month, which is not suitable for small projects and 
early-stage startups. 

In this project, we migrated a set of 6 microservices from EKS to Elastic Container Service (ECS)
to save costs and improve programmer productivity. The project was a success, and we were 
able to save around 50% of the costs 

The stack we used for the project includes but not limited to the following technologies:
1. Terraform for infrastructure as code
2. Docker for containerization
3. AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) for running containers
4. AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storing container images
6. AWS Secrte Manager for storing secrets
7. AWS Load Balancer for routing traffic to the services
