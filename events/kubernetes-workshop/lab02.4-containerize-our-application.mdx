In this lab, we will containerize our application. We write Dockerfile for 
our Python FastAPI application as well as our Next.js frontend application.
Then we will build an image from our Dockerfile and run a container from 
the Image. At the end of this lab, we will have our application runing 
with `docker compose` command.

## Objectives
1. Write Dockerfile for Python FastAPI application
2. Build an image for FastAPI application
3. Run a container that starts up our FastAPI application
4. Write Dockerfile for Next.JS application.
5. Build an image from Next.JS Dockerfile
6. Run a container that starts up our Next.JS application
7. Write a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run both applications
8. Start both applications with `docker-compose up` command


## Instructions

### 1. Write Dockerfile for Python FastAPI application
We write following Dockerfile for our Python FastAPI application.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT [ "uvicorn", "main:app", "--reload"] 
CMD ["--port", "5000", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
EXPOSE 5000
```
As we see the Dockerfile, uses `requirements.txt` file to install 
the dependencies. Then it copies the source code to the container 
and runs the server. The content of `requirements.txt` file is as follows.
```plaintext
fastapi==0.110.0
uvicorn==0.26.0
```

### 2. Build an image for FastAPI application
We build an image from the Dockerfile using the following command.
```bash
docker build -t fastapi-app .
```

### 3. Run a container that starts up our FastAPI application
We run a container from the image using the following command.
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 fastapi-app
```


### 4. Write Dockerfile for Next.JS application
We write following Dockerfile for our Next.JS application.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.18

LABEL MAINTAINER="Mehrshad Lotfi <mehrshad@optiop.org>"

WORKDIR /usr/src

COPY ["package.json", "."]

RUN npm install

COPY [".", "/usr/src"]

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
```

### 5. Build an image from Next.JS Dockerfile
We build an image from the Dockerfile using the following command.
```bash
docker build -t nextjs-app .
```

### 6. Run a container that starts up our Next.JS application
We run a container from the image using the following command.
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 nextjs-app
```

### 7. Write a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run both applications
We write a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run both applications.
  
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  fastapi-app:
    image: fastapi-app
    build: backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  nextjs-app:
    image: nextjs-app
    build: frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

### 8. Start both applications with `docker-compose up` command
We start both applications using the following command.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
