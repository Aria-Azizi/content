## Introduction

Observability is a crucial factor in the success of any business.
To achieve observability, we can leverage the power of Grafana,
an open-source platform that enables us to query, visualize, alert
, and understand our metrics.

In this blog we demonstrate how can use Grafana to visualize data 
in our Postgres database. Furthormore, we deploy Grafana on 
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), a fully managed container 
orchestration service. By the end of this blog,
you will have a good understanding of Grafana, and ECS.

The source code for this post is available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/optiop/postgres-grafana-on-ecs)

## Background

### Grafana - The Open Observability Platform
Grafana is a powerful open-source platform for querying, visualizing, alerting, and 
understanding metrics. To get started with Grafana, we can easily run a Grafana 
container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana --rm grafana/grafana
```

After executing the command if we visit `http://localhost:3000` in our browser, we 
will be directed to the Grafana login page. The default username and password 
for logging in are `admin` and `admin`.

### Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ecs/) is a 
fully managed container orchestration service that allows us to run, stop,
and manage Docker containers on a cluster. ECS eliminates the need to install, operate,
and scale our own cluster management infrastructure. With simple API calls, we can launch
and stop Docker-enabled applications, and access
many features like security groups, Elastic Load Balancing, EBS volumes, and IAM roles.


## Architecture Overview
[The official Grafana Postgres plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/postgres/)
allows us to query and visualize data stored in our Postgres database.
With this plugin, administrators can create alerts and visualization dashboards 
based on the data in the Postgres database,
while users can view these dashboards and monitor the alerts.

Inside [`postgres-grafana-on-ecs/src/`](https://github.com/optiop/postgres-grafana-on-ecs/tree/main/src) 
we have setup a development environment. The `docker-compose.yml` file contains two services:
1. `postgres` - A Postgres database container. The container uses 
    [`init.sql`](https://github.com/optiop/postgres-grafana-on-ecs/blob/main/src/postgres/init.sql) 
    to create a table and insert some data into it.
2. `grafana` - A Grafana container. The container uses 
    [`provisioning/datasources/postgres.yaml`](https://github.com/optiop/postgres-grafana-on-ecs/blob/main/src/grafana/provisioning/datasources/postgres.yaml)
    to configure the Postgres data source.

To start the development environment, we can run the following command inside the `postgres-grafana-on-ecs/src/` directory:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After running the command, we can visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in our browser 
and log in to Grafana using the default username and password `admin`.
  
## Deployment of Grafana on ECS

To deploy Grafana, and Postgres on ECS, we create a task definition for each service. 
We use EC2 as the launch type for the task definition. 
[The task definition for Grafana](https://github.com/optiop/postgres-grafana-on-ecs/blob/72dc6add7543f1017ff98ac427adb878642db3ec/ops/ecs/modules/grafana/main.tf#L14)
is as follows:

```json
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "grafana",
            "image": "...",
            "cpu": 512,
            "memory": 512,
            "portMappings": [
                {
                    "containerPort": 3000,
                    "hostPort": 3000,
                    "protocol": "tcp"
                }
            ],
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "POSTGRES_USER",
                    "value": "postgres"
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    "cpu": "512",
    "memory": "512",
}
```

The following figure shows the deployment of Grafana on ECS. We are deploying Grafana, and 
Postgres tasks in a public subnet. The Grafana task is behind a load balancer, which
distributes the incoming traffic to the Grafana task. The Postgres task is not behind a load balancer,
and is only accessible from the Grafana task.

## Cost of Running Grafana on ECS
We run the deployment for 5 hours. The cost of running Grafana, and Postgres on ECS is as follows:

<div className="text-center justify-center flex">

    alt='Cost of Running Grafana on ECS'
    width={500}
    height={500}
  />
</div>

As we can see from the image, the network cost is playing a significant role in the total cost.
This include the cost of load balancer, and virtual private cloud (VPC). In our case, we 
are using only the public subnet, which avoid the additional cost of NAT gateway.

## Conclusion
Grafana is a powerful open-source platform which can be used to visualize data in our Postgres database.
We can deploy Grafana as a container on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and benefits from 
the pay as you go model.
